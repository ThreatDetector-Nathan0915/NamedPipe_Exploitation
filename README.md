- Leverages tokens from other processes or users.
- Uses impersonation to execute commands or access resources with elevated privileges.

## Group 4: Interception Scripts

### Interception.ps1
**Purpose**: Intercept and manipulate system calls or data.
**Functionality**:
- Hooks into system processes to intercept data flow.
- Allows for the modification or redirection of intercepted data.

## Group 5: Named Pipe Scripts

### NamedPipe.ps1
**Purpose**: Interact with named pipes for inter-process communication.
**Functionality**:
- Creates, connects to, and communicates through named pipes.
- Uses named pipes to send and receive data between processes.

### RunNamedPipe.bat
**Purpose**: Execute the NamedPipe.ps1 script.
**Functionality**:
- A batch file to run the PowerShell script for named pipe operations.
- Ensures the script is executed in a proper environment.

## Group 6: Vulnerable Service Scripts

### VulnerableService.ps1
**Purpose**: Identify and exploit vulnerable services.
**Functionality**:
- Scans for services with known vulnerabilities.
- Attempts to exploit these services to gain control or escalate privileges.

### DetectableVulnerableService.ps1
**Purpose**: Test detection of vulnerable services.
**Functionality**:
- Sets up scenarios where vulnerable services are detectable.
- Used to test monitoring and alerting systems for vulnerable services.
